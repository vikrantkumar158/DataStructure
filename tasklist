Linked List  	 
> Add first & last , second & second last ...... in O(n) - ( Recursive and Non recursive)
> Merging Point of Linked Lists ( slow and fast, hashing)

Priority Queues and Heaps	
> Merge K sorted linked list

Greedy Algorithms
> Knapsack	
> Interval Scheduling

Trees
> Iterative Traversals (Inorder, Preorder and Postorder).
> Path in the Tree ( Highest cost , Print the paths)
> -Vertical Order Traversal 
> Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List
> -Delete a Node in BST 
> Palindromic tree 
> -Lowest Common Ancestor
> -Diameter of a Binary Tree 
> -Construct a Tree from Inorder and Preorder, 
> Construct a Tree from InOrder and PostOrder
> Implement Tree using Array

Suffix Arrays
> Longest Repeated String - Overlapping
> Longest Repeated String - Non - Overlapping
> Longest Repeated String which occurs n times 
> All Anagrams in Dictionary  
> Longest Common Prefix

Balanced Trees
> AVL ( Implementation Optional )
> Red-Black trees ( Will be discussed in tomorrow's class)
> Tries (Will be discussed in tomorrow's class)
